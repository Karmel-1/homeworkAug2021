<Main> There is a  obvious explanation as to bands are great because music is great. Forsure my favorite thing is hearing live music. Often people relate to a band or a band members.

  I remember the year I fell in love with music. I had no idea just how much music would be a part of my life. Preteen boy bands were sweeping the nation and sometimes mischievous rumors would keep them popular. While I was grow into my own different music genres grew on me. I never realized how much music could really help someone. Music allowed me to finish goals, cheered me up, and helped me rant to clear my head. I know at that point music was a part of me and I would be creative without. I know if it helped me on a small level the music therapy could be life changing for others. Creating a search tool that makes it easy connects people with a live experiences to appreciate music will do wonders in other peoples life as well.
